if vec is a stringvector representing an expression , then this returns the stringvector obtained by parenthesizing the expression if it may need parenthesizing . this is used only to prevent parsing errors when the expression appears immediately to the right of an " = " in the spec . this is a rare situation , so it would be nice to add the parentheses only if really necessary . for now , the parentheses are added if one of the following tokens occur outside parentheses and not inside a string : * = < not followed by not followed by > or preceded by = | preceded or followed by - \ not followed by " o " or " x " . / followed by " \ " * left parentheses are * ( [ < < * the handling of " \ " is a simplifying hack . lots of operators beginning with " \ " like " \ / " , " \ gg " and " \ subseteq " have precedence greater than or equal to " = " . the only commonly used ones with precedence lower than " = " seem to be " \ o " and " \ x " . it doesn ' t seem to be worth the bother of checking for the others just to avoid unnecessarily adding the parentheses when those other rare operators are used . * perhaps the one improvement that might be worth making in this procedure is to have it not add parentheses because of " dangerous " operations in an if clause - - for example : * if x < 0 then . . . * this would require considering " if " to be a left parenthesis and " then " to be a right parenthesis . however , that ' s not trivial to implement because of unlikely things like * ifx : = 42 ; x : = ifx < thenx

record audit log for disasterrecoveryservice
parse the pidf input
returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base - level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base - level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side - effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n ' s next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b ' s current successor , which means that we don ' t have a consistent 3 - node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n ' s value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn ' t require restart , they aren ' t sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n ' s predecessor ' s value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we can ' t unlink the node because we don ' t know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b . value check isn ' t strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they can ' t easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed .

this method deals with the fact , that the decoding process doesn ' t always yield a single most likely value . the current error correction implementation doesn ' t deal with erasures very well , so it ' s better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure . the problem is that we don ' t know which of the ambiguous values to choose . we try decode using the first value , and if that fails , we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again . this usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes , so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this .

this is central to the vmaxvolumetoexportmaskruleapplicator class . we are essentially trying to have a wrapper around this method because it needs to be called in different contexts . one context is when this is a native vmax export operation . this context requires workflow steps , so this what the postapply ( ) is for . the second context is when we are suggesting exportmasks to use for a set of initiators for the vplex backend . the vplex backend workflow bypasses these maskingorchestrator implementation and creates steps that reference the exportmaskoperations . so , there ' s no need to have extra workflow steps done after applyrules . we are trying to get only the rules to run so that we have a set of exportmasks that we can suggest for the vplex backend workflow .

main worker run loop . repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them , while coping with a number of issues : 1 . we may start out with an initial task , in which case we don ' t need to get the first one . otherwise , as long as pool is running , we get tasks from gettask . if it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters . other exits result from exception throws in external code , in which case completedabruptly holds , which usually leads processworkerexit to replace this thread . 2 . before running any task , the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing , and then we ensure that unless pool is stopping , this thread does not have its interrupt set . 3 . each task run is preceded by a call to beforeexecute , which might throw an exception , in which case we cause thread to die ( breaking loop with completedabruptly true ) without processing the task . 4 . assuming beforeexecute completes normally , we run the task , gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterexecute . we separately handle runtimeexception , error ( both of which the specs guarantee that we trap ) and arbitrary throwables . because we cannot rethrow throwables within runnable . run , we wrap them within errors on the way out ( to the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler ) . any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die . 5 . after task . run completes , we call afterexecute , which may also throw an exception , which will also cause thread to die . according to jls sec 14 . 20 , this exception is the one that will be in effect even if task . run throws . the net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterexecute and the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code .
convert the long data to a base32 string .
returns date that is represented by a string . it uses the following representation of date . yyyy - mm - dd ' t ' hh : mm : ss based on the following definition of " datetime " attribute in xml schema which can be found at http : / / www . w3 . org / tr / xmlschema - 2 / datetime . a single lexical representation , which is a subset of the lexical representations allowed by [ iso 8601 ] , is allowed for datetime . this lexical representation is the [ iso 8601 ] extended format ccyy - mm - ddthh : mm : ss where " cc " represents the century , " yy " the year , " mm " the month and " dd " the day , preceded by an optional leading " - " sign to indicate a negative number . if the sign is omitted , " + " is assumed . the letter " t " is the date / time separator and " hh " , " mm " , " ss " represent hour , minute and second respectively . additional digits can be used to increase the precision of fractional seconds if desired i . e the format ss . ss . . . with any number of digits after the decimal point is supported . the fractional seconds part is optional ; other parts of the lexical form are not optional . to accommodate year values greater than 9999 additional digits can be added to the left of this representation . leading zeros are required if the year value would otherwise have fewer than four digits ; otherwise they are forbidden . the year 0000 is prohibited . the ccyy field must have at least four digits , the mm , dd , ss , hh , mm and ss fields exactly two digits each ( not counting fractional seconds ) ; leading zeroes must be used if the field would otherwise have too few digits . this representation may be immediately followed by a " z " to indicate coordinated universal time ( utc ) or , to indicate the time zone , i . e . the difference between the local time and coordinated universal time , immediately followed by a sign , + or - , followed by the difference from utc represented as hh : mm ( note : the minutes part is required ) . see iso 8601 date and time formats ( ' d ) for details about legal values in the various fields . if the time zone is included , both hours and minutes must be present . for example , to indicate 1 : 20 pm on may the 31st , 1999 for eastern standard time which is 5 hours behind coordinated universal time ( utc ) , one would write : 1999 - 05 - 31t13 : 20 : 00 - 05 : 00 .

internal method for allocation . this takes a forced approach to allocation to ensure that we manage reservation boundary issues consistently . allocation is always done through the entire tree . the two options that we influence are whether the allocation should be forced and whether or not the peak memory allocation should be updated . if at some point during allocation escalation we determine that the allocation is no longer possible , we will continue to do a complete and consistent allocation but we will stop updating the peak allocation . we do this because we know that we will be directly unwinding this allocation ( and thus never actually making the allocation ) . if force allocation is passed , then we continue to update the peak limits since we now know that this allocation will occur despite our moving past one or more limits .

guides the allowed concurrency among update operations . used as a hint for internal sizing . the table is internally partitioned to try to permit the indicated number of concurrent updates without contention . because placement in hash tables is essentially random , the actual concurrency will vary . ideally , you should choose a value to accommodate as many threads as will ever concurrently modify the table . using a significantly higher value than you need can waste space and time , and a significantly lower value can lead to thread contention . but overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not usually have much noticeable impact . a value of one is appropriate when it is known that only one thread will modify and all others will only read . defaults to 16 .

gets the bytes that originally defined a given class . this method tries first to load the class from a backup file created in the filesystem just before that class was enhanced .
main worker run loop . repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them , while coping with a number of issues : 1 . we may start out with an initial task , in which case we don ' t need to get the first one . otherwise , as long as pool is running , we get tasks from gettask . if it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters . other exits result from exception throws in external code , in which case completedabruptly holds , which usually leads processworkerexit to replace this thread . 2 . before running any task , the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing , and then we ensure that unless pool is stopping , this thread does not have its interrupt set . 3 . each task run is preceded by a call to beforeexecute , which might throw an exception , in which case we cause thread to die ( breaking loop with completedabruptly true ) without processing the task . 4 . assuming beforeexecute completes normally , we run the task , gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterexecute . we separately handle runtimeexception , error ( both of which the specs guarantee that we trap ) and arbitrary throwables . because we cannot rethrow throwables within runnable . run , we wrap them within errors on the way out ( to the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler ) . any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die . 5 . after task . run completes , we call afterexecute , which may also throw an exception , which will also cause thread to die . according to jls sec 14 . 20 , this exception is the one that will be in effect even if task . run throws . the net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterexecute and the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code .

gets the overlap between this interval and another interval . intervals are inclusive of the start instant and exclusive of the end . an interval overlaps another if it shares some common part of the datetime continuum . this method returns the amount of the overlap , only if the intervals actually do overlap . if the intervals do not overlap , then null is returned . when two intervals are compared the result is one of three states : ( a ) they abut , ( b ) there is a gap between them , ( c ) they overlap . the abuts state takes precedence over the other two , thus a zero duration interval at the start of a larger interval abuts and does not overlap . the chronology of the returned interval is the same as that of this interval ( the chronology of the interval parameter is not used ) . note that the use of the chronology was only correctly implemented in version 1 . 3 .

this method deals with the fact , that the decoding process doesn ' t always yield a single most likely value . the current error correction implementation doesn ' t deal with erasures very well , so it ' s better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure . the problem is that we don ' t know which of the ambiguous values to choose . we try decode using the first value , and if that fails , we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again . this usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes , so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this .

this will place the connection for the host + port into the pinned list . this will be used as a way to prevent the connection from getting reaped while it is in use for a long period of time . we ' re keeping count of the times that pinconnection is being called for the connection . this is because you can have multiple arrays behind a single provider ip . if discovery is run against the provider , then the same client will be used for all of its arrays . we would need to keep count , so only when the last array ' s discovery is complete , we can safely remove the connection from the pinned list .
util method to write an attribute without the ns prefix
returns true if a usage record for the given variable inside a filter or bind / values node has been recorded . the rationale of this check is as follows : if a variable used inside a static binding is queries in such an ancestor filter , the binding must not be considered global . as an example , consider the following query : select * where filter ( ! bound ( ? x ) ) bind ( 1 as ? x ) expected result is the empty set , according to bottom - up semantics . we must * not * rewrite this query as select * where filter ( ! bound ( ? x ) ) values ? x 1 the reason is that in this case the filter will pass , while ? x in the original query the bind ( 1 as ? x ) is in scope and the filter fails . the same holds for queries where the filter is at the same level as the bind / values clause , such as : select * where filter ( ! bound ( ? x ) ) bind ( 1 as ? x )

this method determines which menu items get to be ' action items ' that will appear in an action bar and which items should be ' overflow items ' in a secondary menu . the rules are as follows : items are considered for inclusion in the order specified within the menu . there is a limit of mmaxactionitems as a total count , optionally including the overflow menu button itself . this is a soft limit ; if an item shares a group id with an item previously included as an action item , the new item will stay with its group and become an action item itself even if it breaks the max item count limit . this is done to limit the conceptual complexity of the items presented within an action bar . only a few unrelated concepts should be presented to the user in this space , and groups are treated as a single concept . there is also a hard limit of consumed measurable space : mactionwidthlimit . this limit may be broken by a single item that exceeds the remaining space , but no further items may be added . if an item that is part of a group cannot fit within the remaining measured width , the entire group will be demoted to overflow . this is done to ensure room for navigation and other affordances in the action bar as well as reduce general ui clutter . the space freed by demoting a full group cannot be consumed by future menu items . once items begin to overflow , all future items become overflow items as well . this is to avoid inadvertent reordering that may break the app ' s intended design .

helper method to retrieve the line number on the other side . given a line number on one side , performs a binary search in the linemap to find the corresponding linegap record . a linegap records gap information from the start of an actual gap up to the start of the next gap . in the following example , linemapatob will have linegap : start : 1 , end : - 1 , delta : 3 ( end set to - 1 to represent a dummy gap of length zero . the binary search only looks at start so setting it to - 1 has no effect here . ) linemapbtoa will have linegap : start : 1 , end : 3 , delta : - 3 these linegaps control lines between 1 and 5 . the " delta " is computed as the number to add on our side to get the line number on the other side given a line after the actual gap , so the result will be ( line + delta ) . all lines within the actual gap ( 1 to 3 ) are considered corresponding to the last line above the region on the other side , which is 0 in this case . for these lines , we do ( end + delta ) . for example , to get the line number on the left corresponding to 1 on the right ( lineonother ( revision , 1 ) ) , the method looks up in linemapbtoa , finds the " delta " to be - 3 , and returns 3 + ( - 3 ) = 0 since 1 falls in the actual gap . on the other hand , the line corresponding to 5 on the right will be 5 + ( - 3 ) = 2 , since 5 is in the region after the gap ( but still controlled by the current linegap ) . parent revision 0 | 0 - | 1 \ \ - | 2 | actual insertion gap | - | 3 / | region controlled by one linegap 1 | 4 < - delta = 4 - 1 = 3 | 2 | 5 / - | 6 . . .

the opensession ( ) method starts the otr protocol . it creates a basicchan object that is passed into otrsendalice and when the key exchange is complete , this chan " chan " is notified and an otrsession object is returned . we also create a sessionimpl object for handling messages and pass that into both our otrsendalice object and the returned otrsession object . to start the actual protocol , a specific string needs to be crafted . in our implementation , we used " ? otrv23 ? " which means we are initializing otr version 3 , with version 2 as a backup if version 3 is not available . other protocol strings are possible . we then call chan . receive ( ) , and when the key exchange in otrsendalice returns , we check to see if the key exchange was successful or not . if it is , we return a new otrsession object . else , we shut everything down . note : the otrpolicy variable allows otrv2 and otrv3 . this can be changed if the user desires different versions of otr .

returns a string representation of the dimensions of this subspace separated by comma .
returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base - level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base - level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side - effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n ' s next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b ' s current successor , which means that we don ' t have a consistent 3 - node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n ' s value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn ' t require restart , they aren ' t sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n ' s predecessor ' s value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we can ' t unlink the node because we don ' t know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b . value check isn ' t strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they can ' t easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed .

this method deals with the fact , that the decoding process doesn ' t always yield a single most likely value . the current error correction implementation doesn ' t deal with erasures very well , so it ' s better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure . the problem is that we don ' t know which of the ambiguous values to choose . we try decode using the first value , and if that fails , we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again . this usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes , so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this .
