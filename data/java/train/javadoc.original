returns true if the passed - in process listener is for an air application that has terminated . this is used by accept ( ) in order to detect that it should give up listening on the socket . the reason we can ' t do this for flash player - based apps is that unlike air apps , the process that we launched sometimes acts as just sort of a " launcher " process that terminates quickly , and the actual flash player is in some other process . for example , on mac , we often invoke the " open " program to open a web browser ; and on windows , if you launch firefox . exe but it detects that there is already a running instance of firefox . exe , the new instance will just pass a message to the old instance , and then the new instance will terminate .

overridden to return false , and if the event is a mouse event it is forwarded to the tree . the behavior for this is debatable , and should really be offered as a property . by returning false , all keyboard actions are implemented in terms of the table . by returning true , the tree would get a chance to do something with the keyboard events . for the most part this is ok . but for certain keys , such as left / right , the tree will expand / collapse where as the table focus should really move to a different column . page up / down should also be implemented in terms of the table . by returning false this also has the added benefit that clicking outside of the bounds of the tree node , but still in the tree column will select the row , whereas if this returned true that wouldn ' t be the case . by returning false we are also enforcing the policy that the tree will never be editable ( at least by a key sequence ) .

modify vec so the line mapping nl it represents is related to the original line mapping ol by nl [ c ] = if c < col then ol [ c ] else ol [ c ] + incr . in other words , if adding n characters ( or removing - incr characters ) before the character in column c , then call adjustmappingpairvector ( c , n , . . . ) . however , if replacing a token of length blen at column c by an expression of length nlen , then call adjustmappingpairvector ( c + 1 , nlen - olen , . . . ) because : ( a ) the beginning position of the expression is the same as that of the token , and ( b ) one should never be looking at or modifying anything inside the expression , so we can call adjustmappingpairvector with any first argument between c + 1 and c + ( length of original token ) .

adds all the rules to this ruleset from the given other rule set .
appends a default value for a field to the formatter for use in parsing . this appends an instruction to the builder to inject a default value into the parsed result . this is especially useful in conjunction with optional parts of the formatter . for example , consider a formatter that parses the year , followed by an optional month , with a further optional day - of - month . using such a formatter would require the calling code to check whether a full date , year - month or just a year had been parsed . this method can be used to default the month and day - of - month to a sensible value , such as the first of the month , allowing the calling code to always get a date . during formatting , this method has no effect . during parsing , the current state of the parse is inspected . if the specified field has no associated value , because it has not been parsed successfully at that point , then the specified value is injected into the parse result . injection is immediate , thus the field - value pair will be visible to any subsequent elements in the formatter . as such , this method is normally called at the end of the builder .

build mapping tables based on the line count of the given source string . these tables allow us to compute starting and ending locations of each line of the source file . the assumption using this technique is that most lines of the source files will never be accessed thus we only incur the overhead of 8 bytes ( start & end ) per line , plus the actual string contents each line a line is requested . thus we need 8 * num files * num lines per file bytes for all these maps . for example , say each file is 1000 lines and we have 400 source files ; we would consume 3 . 2mb . with each request we would allocate an additional 20 + bytes for the string ( assuming a 20b avg line length ) . allocating each line individually we would consume 1000 * 400 * 20 = 8mb . it is debatable whether this scheme is more efficient than actually builing an array of strings to contain the lines , but gut feel says it is ; )

( try to ) trim the pool until its total space falls below the max size ( soft cap ) . this will get rid of values on the free list , until the free lists are empty , or we fall below the max size ; whichever comes first . note : it is not an error if we have eliminated all the free values , but the pool is still above its max size ( soft cap ) the approach we take is to go from the smallest sized bucket down to the largest sized bucket . this may seem a bit counter - intuitive , but the rationale is that allocating larger - sized values is more expensive than the smaller - sized ones , so we want to keep them around for a while .

returns the next pseudorandom , uniformly distributed float value between 0 . 0 and 1 . 0 from this random number generator ' s sequence . the general contract of nextfloat is that one float value , chosen ( approximately ) uniformly from the range 0 . 0f ( inclusive ) to 1 . 0f ( exclusive ) , is pseudorandomly generated and returned . all 224 possible float values of the form mx & nbsp2 - 24 , where m is a positive integer less than 224 , are produced with ( approximately ) equal probability . the method nextfloat is implemented by class random as follows : public float nextfloat ( ) return next ( 24 ) / ( ( float ) ( 1 < < 24 ) ) ; the hedge " approximately " is used in the foregoing description only because the next method is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen bits . if it were a perfect source or randomly chosen bits , then the algorithm shown would choose float values from the stated range with perfect uniformity . [ in early versions of java , the result was incorrectly calculated as : return next ( 30 ) / ( ( float ) ( 1 < < 30 ) ) ; this might seem to be equivalent , if not better , but in fact it introduced a slight nonuniformity because of the bias in the rounding of floating - point numbers : it was slightly more likely that the low - order bit of the significand would be 0 than that it would be 1 . ]

method for invoking a known database prepared statement to compress a designated table . typically this is done after a nontrivial number of deletions from a table have occurred , and the current database implementation is know to be a lazy space reclaimer ( e . g . , derby ) . notes : at this time , apache derby is the database implementation in use , and derby has a few important " oh by the way ( s ) " : 1 ) either of the prepared statements : syscs util . syscs compress table ( ) syscs util . syscs inplace compress table ( ) should be called in autocommit mode . this should already be so for a new connection , by default , but as a formality , we ensure it . since we will not reuse the connection object , we will not worry about restoration . 2 ) see the derby documentation for discussion of the parameters to these prepared statements . they have important consequences for the type and duration of processing which occurs . 3 ) in practice , syscs util . syscs compress table ( ) seems to incur deadlock with concurrent anomaly detection engine analyze processing ( and perhaps others , as well ) , whereas syscs util . syscs inplace compress table ( ) does not seem to . the scoping of this method and the default ( " in place = = true " ) reflects the fact that only the in - place form is trusted by anomaly detection engine at this time ( and so this is currently the only way it is offered publicly ) . note also that both prepared statements acquire an exclusive table lock for their duration . experience shows that explicit acquisition beforehand does not seem to provide any help in avoiding deadlock ( contrary to any internet testimonials one may find ) .

attempt to recover from a syntax error . this returns false if recovery fails , true if it succeeds . recovery happens in 4 steps . first we pop the parse stack down to a point at which we have a shift out of the top - most state on the error symbol . this represents the initial error recovery configuration . if no such configuration is found , then we fail . next a small number of " lookahead " or " parse ahead " symbols are read into a buffer . the size of this buffer is determined by error sync size ( ) and determines how many symbols beyond the error must be matched to consider the recovery a success . next , we begin to discard symbols in attempt to get past the point of error to a point where we can continue parsing . after each symbol , we attempt to " parse ahead " though the buffered lookahead symbols . the " parse ahead " process simulates that actual parse , but does not modify the real parser ' s configuration , nor execute any actions . if we can parse all the stored symbols without error , then the recovery is considered a success . once a successful recovery point is determined , we do an actual parse over the stored input - - modifying the real parse configuration and executing all actions . finally , we return the the normal parser to continue with the overall parse .

internal - - push the global variables from the stylesheet onto the context ' s runtime variable stack . if we encounter a variable that is already defined in the variable stack , we ignore it . this is because the second variable definition will be at a lower import precedence . presumably , global " variables at the same import precedence with the same name will have been caught during the recompose process . however , if we encounter a parameter that is already defined in the variable stack , we need to see if this is a parameter whose value was supplied by a setparameter call . if so , we need to " receive " the one already in the stack , ignoring this one . if it is just an earlier xsl : param or xsl : variable definition , we ignore it using the same reasoning as explained above for the variable .

the real work of making the state table deterministic happens here . this function merges a state in the state table ( specified by rownum ) with a state that is passed in ( newvalues ) . the basic process is to copy the nonzero cells in newstates into the state in the state table ( we ' ll call that oldvalues ) . if there ' s a collision ( i . e . , if the same cell has a nonzero value in both states , and it ' s not the same value ) , then we have to reconcile the collision . we do this by creating a new state , adding it to the end of the state table , and using this function recursively to merge the original two states into a single , combined state . this process may happen recursively ( i . e . , each successive level may involve collisions ) . to prevent infinite recursion , we keep a log of merge operations . any time we ' re merging two states we ' ve merged before , we can just supply the row number for the result of that merge operation rather than creating a new state just like it .

this method deals with the fact , that the decoding process doesn ' t always yield a single most likely value . the current error correction implementation doesn ' t deal with erasures very well , so it ' s better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure . the problem is that we don ' t know which of the ambiguous values to choose . we try decode using the first value , and if that fails , we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again . this usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes , so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this .

this method sends out n ( for small n ) multicast requests . until the last request is sent out , this method sleeps for 5 seconds after each request is sent . after the last request is sent , this method sleeps for 2 minutes to allow the responselistener time to receive and process any multicast responses sent in reply to the multicast requests . before sending a request , a new multicast request is constructed so that updates can be made to the set of service ids of the lookup services discovered due to previous requests . after all requests have been sent , and the responselistener has been given the appropriate time to receive and process any multicast responses , if there are no more active instances of this thread , this method terminates ( interrupts ) the responselistener . note that although it is more desirable to have the responselistener set a timeout on the server socket ( using setsotimeout ) and then simply exit after a period of time in which both the responselistener has been idle , and there have been no active requestor threads , using setsotimeout in this way can cause random hangs on the solaris ( tm ) operating system .

event elission endeavours to ensure that events processed represent current state change . this is best explained with an example from its original usage in processing graphic events . whilst a " button click " is a singular event and all button clicks should be processed , a " mouse move " event could be elided with the next " mouse move " event . thus the move events ( l1 - > l2 ) and ( l2 - > l3 ) would elide to a single ( l1 - > l3 ) . in ha rmi calls can trigger event processing , whilst other threads monitor state changes - such as open sockets . without elission , monitoring threads will observe unnecessary transitional state changes . however , there remains a problem with this pattern of synchronization .

returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base - level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base - level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side - effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n ' s next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b ' s current successor , which means that we don ' t have a consistent 3 - node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n ' s value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn ' t require restart , they aren ' t sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n ' s predecessor ' s value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we can ' t unlink the node because we don ' t know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b . value check isn ' t strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they can ' t easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed .

separates the graphics from the omgraphiclist into polygon , polyline and point lists , then passes the desired shape lists to their respective export functions to be added to an esrilayer of the same type and prepared for export . omgraphics that are on sublists within the top - level omgraphiclist will be simply written to the appropriate list at the top level of that list . they will be handled as multi - part geometries . separating the graphics into the three types is necessary due to shape file specification limitations which will only allow shape files to be of one type . for omgraphiclists that are actually esrigraphiclists , this export method will be redirected to a different method that will handle sub - omgraphiclists as multi - part geometries . if you want to write out multi - part geometries and have a regular omgraphiclist , you have to convert them to esrigraphiclists first ( and omgraphics to esrigraphics ) , which forces you to group shapes into like types ( points , polylines and polygons ) .

scale the partials at a given node . this uses a scaling suggested by ziheng yang in yang ( 2000 ) j . mol . evol . 51 : 423 - 432 this function looks over the partial likelihoods for each state at each pattern and finds the largest . if this is less than the scalingthreshold ( currently set to 1e - 40 ) then it rescales the partials for that pattern by dividing by this number ( i . e . , normalizing to between 0 , 1 ) . it then stores the log of this scaling . this is called for every internal node after the partials are calculated so provides most of the performance hit . ziheng suggests only doing this on a proportion of nodes but this sounded like a headache to organize ( and he doesn ' t use the threshold idea which improves the performance quite a bit ) .

is this instruction a " beginning instruction " . a beginning instruction is defined to be an instruction that can be the first successfully executed instruction in the method . the first instruction is always a beginning instruction . if the first instruction can throw an exception , and is covered by a try block , then the first instruction of any exception handler for that try block is also a beginning instruction . and likewise , if any of those instructions can throw an exception and are covered by try blocks , the first instruction of the corresponding exception handler is a beginning instruction , etc . to determine this , we simply check if the first predecessor is the fake " startofmethod " instruction , which has an instruction index of - 1 .

returns a pseudorandom , uniformly distributed int value between 0 ( inclusive ) and the specified value ( exclusive ) , drawn from this random number generator ' s sequence . the general contract of nextint is that one int value in the specified range is pseudorandomly generated and returned . all n possible int values are produced with ( approximately ) equal probability . the method nextint ( int n ) is implemented by class random as follows : public int nextint ( int n ) if ( n > 31 ) ; int bits , val ; do bits = next ( 31 ) ; val = bits % n ; while ( bits - val + ( n - 1 ) < 0 ) ; return val ; the hedge " approximately " is used in the foregoing description only because the next method is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen bits . if it were a perfect source of randomly chosen bits , then the algorithm shown would choose int values from the stated range with perfect uniformity . the algorithm rejects values that would result in an uneven distribution ( due to the fact that 2 ^ 31 is not divisible by n ) . the probability of a value being rejected depends on n . the worst case is n = 2 ^ 30 + 1 , for which the probability of a reject is 1 / 2 , and the expected number of iterations before the loop terminates is 2 . the algorithm treats the case where n is a power of two specially : it returns the correct number of high - order bits from the underlying pseudo - random number generator . in the absence of special treatment , the correct number of low - order bits would be returned . linear congruential pseudo - random number generators such as the one implemented by this class are known to have short periods in the sequence of values of their low - order bits . thus , this special case greatly increases the length of the sequence of values returned by successive calls to this method if n is a small power of two .
